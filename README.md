## Goal:

Show that it is easy to extract insights from PDFs. In this example, I take a syllabus from one of my graduate courses and condense it into a bulletted list of topics for a potential next student.

## Use case:

Graduate degrees vary by name and course content. Current or prospective graduate students need to identify appropriate programs based on the courses they offer. This helps identify the correct programs or univerities, which benefits the student and school. Everybody wants graduate students to complete their degree and proceed to better things, but taking the wrong courses or entering the wrong program will impede that.

## Full application:

This example works for the specific use case, but changing the context and prompt will permit any use case with topic extraction. There may be a need for additional preprocessing, especially if the text is long, containing many tokens. With small adjustments this code will adapt to a variety of circumstances.
